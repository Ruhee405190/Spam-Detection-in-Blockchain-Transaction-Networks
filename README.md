# Spam-Detection-in-Blockchain-Transaction-Networks
This project focuses on detecting spam or malicious behavior within blockchain transaction networks using data analysis and machine learning techniques. It aims to enhance the integrity and security of blockchain ecosystems by identifying abnormal patterns indicative of spam transactions.
The main objective is to build a reliable and scalable model that can automatically spot suspicious activity in blockchain transactions. By using real data and intelligent algorithms, we aim to make blockchain ecosystems more secure and resilient to spam.
Gets the Data Right: We start by collecting raw blockchain transaction data and cleaning it up for analysis.

Looks for Patterns: We engineer features that help the model understand transaction behavior — like frequency, volume, and timing.

Trains Smart Models: We use machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and SVM to train models that can recognize spammy patterns.

Checks Accuracy: The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure they’re actually doing the job well.

Visualizes the Findings: Charts and graphs help us (and you!) clearly see what’s going on inside the network.
